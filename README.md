# RayTracing Tutorial

This project follows the ray tracing tutorial series by The Cherno (https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlrATfBNZ98edc5GshdBtREv5asFW3yXl). The code present in this repository is not my original creation.

## Getting Started
Once you've cloned, run `scripts/Setup.bat` to generate Visual Studio 2022 solution/project files. Make sure you have the Vulkan SDK installed and a graphics card that supports it. To run the project, simply open the Visual Studio solution and click on the play button or the associated keyboard shortcut.
